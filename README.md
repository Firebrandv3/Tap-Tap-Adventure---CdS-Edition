# Tap Tap Adventure

    Tap Tap Adventure is an advanced expasion of the 2012 experimental HTML5 game developed by Little Workshop to show how WebSockets could be used to create a realtime MMORPG in the comfort of your browser.

    With the visual potential behind the original game, TTA takes a leap forward towards expanding the game from many of the ideas and suggestions from earlier development releases of the game. Thus, with the expansion hundreds of new mobs, items, and sprites have been added to the game to offer a higher field of actions. 

    Further accomplishments include improvements towards the rendering engine, game engine, migration of WebSockets to Socket.IO, quests, levels, new areas, inventory, party system, character information, database saving, API login & registration, and abilities. The list does not cover all of the new features and is but merely to point in the direction the game is heading.

    The initial intent behind TTA is to offer a large-scaled MMORPG whereby players are able to access it from all devices in a comfortable manner, thus said the data, RAM, and CPU usage must be maintained at a minimal to ensure perfect compatibility. HTML5 comes into play when we wish to allow players to access the game from a wide variety of devices. This includes Android and Apple phones, phablets and tablets as well as Linux based machines and older OS computers.
