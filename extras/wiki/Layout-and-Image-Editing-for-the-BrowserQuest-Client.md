## Layout Editing

Want to change the way BrowserQuest looks? Some tips/advice for editing images within BrowserQuest. Some images have 3 copies, each with their own sizes. These images will be in /client/img/[3,2,1]

## Tilesheet

* /client/img/3/tilesheet.png - 960 x 4704 Pixels - Large Image of Tilesheet in Directory 3
* /client/img/2/tilesheet.png - 640 x 3136 Pixels - Medium Image of Tilesheet in Directory 2
* /client/img/1/tilesheet.png - 320 x 1568 Pixels - Small Image of Tilesheet in Directory 1

While the best way to get a slick look on graphics would be to start with the biggest images (directory #3) and reduce them, in this case, the retro-gaming looks of browser quest, it appears they started with the smallest tilesheet and made it bigger using no extrapolation of any sorts.
The figure below presents the smallest tilesheet zoomed in (300%) and the biggest one normal zoom (100%):
