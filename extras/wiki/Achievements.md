Each achievement consists of an object defined in `initAchievements()` in `client/js/game.js`:
* `id` -- `(number)`
* `name` -- `(string)`Name of the achievement
* `desc` -- `(string)`Description of the achievement
* `isCompleted` -- `(function)`A function that returns a boolean of the achievement being achieved yet or not
* `hidden` -- `(boolean)`Whether or not the achievement shows up in the Achievements book before completion.
