Banking System:

This is important, we should allow players to have a maximum of 20 banking spaces, members
will receive an extra 30. The banking system must contain the following: 
    - A way of having it organized (tabs)
    - Counter (display the number of items in the bank)
    - Anti-Dupe System
    
The bank system will be very similar to the way the Inventory System functions, in the sense that it'll
be handled with slots, more than 5 and storing it over Redis.
